# Snyk Orb for CircleCI

## The Snyk Orb

Use the Snyk orb to easily integrate Snyk into your CircleCI Workflows.
This orb allows you to use Snyk to find, fix and monitor for vulnerabilities in application dependencies and Docker images. You can also scan Terraform, Kubernetes, and CloudFormation manifests for misconfigurations. Advanced functionality such as setting thresholds for vulnerability tolerance to fail workflows, applying proprietary Snyk patches, and saving dependency snapshots on snyk.io for continuous monitoring is also available.

## How to use the Snyk Orb

In fact, it is very easy to start using the Orb.
All you need to do is:

1. Follow the instructions at the [Orb Quick Start Guide](https://circleci.com/orbs/registry/orb/snyk/snyk#quick-start) to enable usage of Orbs in your project workflow.
2. [Register for a Snyk Account](https://snyk.co/udtEr), then set up an environment variable (`SNYK_TOKEN`) with your Snyk API token, which you can get from your [account](https://app.snyk.io/account).
3. In the config.yml file, invoke the Snyk scan you'd like to run. Three jobs are available: `snyk/opensource`, `snyk/container`, and `snyk/iac`.
4. Provide additional parameters to customize orb behaviour.

## Usage Examples

### Scan App Dependencies

```yaml
version: 2.1

  orbs:
    snyk: snyk/snyk@x.y.z

  jobs:
    build:
      docker:
        - image: circleci/node:4.8.2
      steps:
        - checkout
        - run: npm install -q
        - snyk/opensource
```

### Scan Docker Images or OCI archives

```yaml
version: 2.1

orbs:
  snyk: snyk/snyk@x.y.z

jobs:
  build:
    environment:
      IMAGE_NAME: myrepo/myapp
    docker:
        - image: circleci/buildpack-deps:stretch
    steps:
      - checkout
      - setup_remote_docker
      - run:
          name: Build Docker image
          command: docker build -t $IMAGE_NAME:latest .
      - snyk/container:
          token-variable: SNYK_TOKEN
          docker-image-name: $IMAGE_NAME:latest
          target-file: "Dockerfile"
```

### Advanced Example

```yaml
version: 2.1

orbs:
snyk: snyk/snyk@x.y.z

jobs:
build:
    docker:
    - image: circleci/node:4.8.2
    steps:
    - checkout
    - run:
        command: npm install -q
    - snyk/opensource:
        token-variable: CICD_SNYK_TOKEN                           # use is api token stored in an env variable named other than SNYK_TOKEN
        severity-threshold: high                                  # only fail if detected high-severity vulnerabilities
        protect: true                                             # apply pactches specified in commited .snyk file (generated by running the [snyk wizard](https://snyk.io/docs/cli-wizard/))
        fail-on-issues: false                                     # don't fail even if issues detected (not recommended!)
        monitor-on-build: true                                    # create a snapshot of apps dependencies on snyk.io, for continoues monitoring (recommended!)
        project: ${CIRCLE_PROJECT_REPONAME}/${CIRCLE_BRANCH}-app  # use this to save the snapshot under specific names.
        organization: ${SNYK_CICD_ORGANIZATION}                   # save reports under a specific Snyk organization
```
